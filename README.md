# The influence of women in time and domain

## Abstract
Throughout this project we are looking into where women are given voices and the freedom to speak but also about what they speak. The goal is to analyze trends about which newspapers but more generally which countries quote a similar proportion of men and women and additionally in which fields they are quoted, may it be politics, sports, culture or others. In recent years, the feminist movement has evolved and continues to do so, for equal representation, pay and respect.
Studies have shown that representation is important for inspiration and has positive feedback in spreading gender equality. We therefore want to see whether media coverage gives the same possibilities to all voices, regardless if gender.


## Research questions

This study aims at answering the following questions:
 
- Are women or men more quoted in journals/Is the representation equal between men and women in journals?
- How does the distribution of quotes based on gender vary across countries?
- How does the distribution of quotes based on gender vary across? 
- If men have a higher tendency to be quoted, in which domains is it the case and by how much?
- How does the distribution of quotes between genders evolve in time, geographically and themaitcally?


Extra:

- Are men more likely to be quoted in a highly respected journal --> define highly respected
- Is there a tendency in each category for a men to hold longer quotes than women

## Additional datasets

We are interested in linking the quote to a geographical place, we do so by taking the origin of location of the journal. We would use the WikidataAPI to extract the information of interest of a given journal.
