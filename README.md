# The influence of women in time and domain
TODO: CHange title for "more catch" #Lisa
TODO: Change women to female and men to male  
Throughout this project we are looking into where women are given voices and the freedom to speak but also about what they speak. The goal is to analyze trends about which newspapers but more generally analyse the proportion of quotes told by men and women and additionally in which fields they are quoted, may it be politics, sports, culture or others. In recent years, the feminist movement has evolved and continues to do so, for equal representation, pay and respect.
Studies have shown that representation is important for inspiration and has positive feedback in spreading gender equality. We therefore want to see whether media coverage gives the same possibilities to all voices, regardless of gender.

TODO:Be inspired  

TODO: Careful when talking about journal, state media instead for now 


## Research questions

This study aims at answering the following questions:
 
- Are women or men more quoted in journals/Is the representation equal between men and women in media?
- How does the distribution of quotes based on gender vary across countries?
- How does the distribution of quotes based on gender vary across domains? 
- If men have a higher tendency to be quoted, in which domains is it the case and by how much?
- How does the distribution of quotes between genders evolve in time, geographically and themaitcally?
- Is there a tendency in each category for a men to hold longer quotes than women
- Are men more likely to be quoted in highly respected media  --> define highly respected
- Are there any blind spots in media where women are really neglected
- Is there a difference in how women/men a certain age are quoted. 

To discsuss with TA:

## Additional datasets

We are interested in linking the quote to a geographical place, we do so by taking the origin of location of the journal. We would use the WikidataAPI to extract the information of interest of a given journal.
Dataset which groups a list of words 
Subset of wikidata which links QID to name.

## Questions for TA:
Arthur:
- Extract the gender of the journalist and see if one is more likely to quote a certain gender
- 

Lavi:
- Is there a prettier way to extract the QID/attributes than the python file API, how to deal with the url not necessarily
- being an alias known to wikidata
- "How" to deal with media which is not in the wikidata dump; where to find country of origin 

Souche:
- How to hand select news/media sources without too much bias ? 
- Same for url topics, how to define a list of categories to search?

Lisa: 

- Choose the prob style 
- verify QID 
- Check if quote is from a language
