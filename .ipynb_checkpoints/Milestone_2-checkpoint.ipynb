    "- How does the distribution of quotes based on gender vary across countries and across domains?\n",
    "- How does the distribution of quotes between genders evolve in time, geographically and thematically?\n",
    "- Is there a tendency in each category for a males to have **longer quotes** than females?\n",
    "- Are males more likely to be **quoted in highly respected media**?\n",
    "- Are there any **blind spots** in media where females are especially neglected?\n",
    "- Is there a difference in how females/males at a certain **age** are quoted?\n",
    "- Are countries known to promote gender equality more likely to reflect this in media compared to the rest of the world   \n",

    "\n",
    "Extra ideas (draft selene):\n",
    "- Can we identify speakers who were quoted and that triggered a change in trend? Example: a woman is quoted once as she talks about topic A. After that we see an increase of women quoted talking about topic A ? Like some turning points in media? \n",
